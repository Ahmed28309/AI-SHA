## School Support Robot:
This project is developed by a team of high-school students to create a functional assistant robot for schools. The robot aims to support teachers, administrators, and parents by performing simple tasks, providing information, and improving campus efficiency.

### Project Overview:
Our robot integrates multiple computing platforms and custom CAD-designed hardware to perform navigation, sensing, and interaction tasks within a school environment. The goal is to build a reliable robot that can assist in daily school operations and serve as a practical learning experience in robotics, programming, and design.

### Core Components:
The robot uses a combination of advanced hardware systems, including:\
• NVIDIA Jetson Nano - used for AI processing and sensor integration\
• Raspberry Pi 4 - handling additional modules, peripherals, and control tasks\
• Intel RealSense D435 depth camera\
• RPLIDAR A2 for 360° mapping\
• BNO055 9-DOF IMU\
• Rotary encoders, audio modules, terminal blocks, wiring, and connectors

### CAD & Mechanical Design:
A major part of this project involves:\
• Designing the robot's frame and mounting points using CAD software\
• Creating 3D-printed and machined parts\
• Structurally integrating sensors, cameras, wheels, and electronics\
• Making assembly-friendly designs for future upgrades\
We aim to create a modular robot that is easy to build, repair, and improve.

### Planned Capabilities:
• Delivering documents or small items\
• Assisting teachers and admin with quick tasks\
• Guiding parents or visitors in the school\
• Providing basic information via voice or screen interface\
• Navigating hallways using LIDAR + depth sensing

### Project Goals:
• Build a helpful and safe school-assistant robot\
• Learn real engineering skills: robotics, CAD, electronics, AI, and software\
• Create a platform future students can build on\
• Show what high-school teams can achieve with teamwork and creativity

## Created by Students
This entire robot - from CAD design to wiring to programming - is built by high-school students passionate about robotics and engineering.
